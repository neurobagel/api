    "definition_text": "The basic antisaccade task is as follows:\r\n\r\nSubjects view a fixation point and a visual target is presented.  Subjects are instructed to make a saccade away from the target (antisaccade).\r\n\r\nFor this version (from Figure 1 of http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929311000612)\r\n\r\nAt the onset of each AS trial, participants were first presented with one of two incentive cues (1500 ms) (Fig. 1). For rewarded trials, the cue consisted of three rectangles containing dollar signs ($ $ $), indicating that money could be earned on that trial if correctly performed. Participants were told that they could win up to US $25 based on their performance during the task. However, they did not know how much they could win on any given trial in order to prevent them from keeping a running tally of their earnings and invoking processes (i.e. working memory) separate from inhibitory control and reward processing. For neutral trials, the three consecutive rectangles each contained a dash (\u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0093), which indicated that no monetary gain was at stake for that trial. After the initial cue, a central red fixation cross subtending \u00e2\u0088\u00bc0.7\u00c2\u00b0 of visual angle appeared (3000 ms), instructing participants to prepare for the target stimulus. The red central fixation then disappeared and a horizontally peripheral target stimulus (yellow spot, subtending \u00e2\u0088\u00bc0.5\u00c2\u00b0) appeared (1500 ms) at an unpredictable location on the horizontal meridian (\u00c2\u00b13\u00c2\u00b0, 6\u00c2\u00b0, or 9\u00c2\u00b0). Participants were instructed to refrain from looking at the stimulus when it appeared but instead move their eyes to its mirror location. Target location was randomized within each run. During the VGS trials, participants were presented with a green fixation cross (1500 ms) which instructed them to look toward the peripheral stimulus when it appeared. No incentive cue was provided for VGS trials. The VGS trials were randomly interspersed between the AS trials to minimize the possibility that participants would establish an inhibitory response set (Velanova et al., 2009), but were not further analyzed. As indicated in previous studies, (Ollinger et al., 2001b and Ollinger et al., 2001a), the inter-trial fixation period was jittered between intervals of 1.5, 3, or 4.5 s (uniformly distributed) and consisted of participants simply fixating a central white cross on a black background. Participants performed three functional runs of the task (5 min 2 s each in duration) for a total of 30 reward AS trials, 30 neutral AS trials and 15 VGS trials.",

For the older age range of 65-90 years old, a new story was developed with content more relevant. The story is shorter and repeated once to enable adequate floor through age 90. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.\r\n    * Verbal Paired Associates\r\n      It now includes a combination of difficult and easy items. For the younger age group (16-69 years) there are 14 items of which 10 are hard. For the older age group (65-90 years), there are 10 items of which six are hard. Delayed Free Recall Trial has been added while Recognition Trial has increased its level of difficulty. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.\r\n    * Visual Reproduction\r\n      While following the same structure and format as seen in WMS-III, there have been a few changes to the subtest. Recognition Trial has been shortened and scoring has been improved. Based on Munro Cullum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research, scoring is easier and faster than previously experienced and emphasizes recall with less focus on drawing accuracy. You can obtain immediate versus delay and recognition versus delay contrast scores.\r\n\r\n8 subtests were eliminated:\r\n\r\n    * Information & Orientation\r\n    * Spatial Span\r\n    * Mental Control\r\n    * Faces\r\n    * Digit Span\r\n    * Family Pictures\r\n    * Letter Number\r\n    * Word List (CVLT-II can be entered int",

The participant&#39;s task is to indicate whether each stimulus is old or new. Responses in recognition memory tests are commonly sorted into four classes: Hits (&#34;old&#34; response to an old stimulus), Misses (&#34;new&#34; response to an old stimulus), False Alarms (&#34;old&#34; response to a new stimulus), and Correct Rejections (&#34;new&#34; response to a new stimulus). By comparing the percentage of responses that fall into each of these classes, the experimenter can assess both a participant&#39;s ability to discriminate between old and new stimuli, and his or her tendency to provide a particular response regardless of the type of stimulus presented. In many recognition memory tests, each old/new judgment is followed by a prompt asking participants to indicate either how confident they are in that old/new judgment, or what type of subjective experience was elicited by the stimulus being judged (e.g., was the old/new judgment accompanied by a vivid recollection of the encoding experience). This additional information can be used to generate and test more precise hypotheses about how recognition memory decisions are made.\r\n\r\nPattern Recognition Memory (PRM) is a specific recognition memory test included in the CANTAB. The participant is presented with a series of 12 visual patterns, one at a time, in the centre of the screen. These patterns are designed so that they cannot easily be given verbal labels. In the recognition phase, the participant is required to choose between a pattern they have already seen and a novel pattern. In this phase, the test patterns are presented in the reverse order to the original order of presentation.\r\nThis is then repeated, with 12 new patterns. The second recognition phase can be given either immediately or after a 20 minute delay.",

SWM is a test of the participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate remembered items in working memory. It is a self-ordered task, which also assesses heuristic strategy. This test is a sensitive measure of frontal lobe and \u00e2\u0080\u0098executive\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dysfunction. It has been shown in recent studies that impaired performance on SWM emerges as a common factor in prepsychosis. The test begins with a number of coloured squares (boxes) being shown on the screen. The aim of this test is that, by touching the boxes and using a process of elimination, the participant should find one blue \u00e2\u0080\u0098token\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in each of a number of boxes and use them to fill up an empty column on the right hand side of the screen. The number of boxes is gradually increased, until it is necessary to search a total of eight boxes. The colour and position of the boxes used are changed from trial to trial to discourage the use of stereotyped search strategies.",

The game was originally developed by cognitive psychologists at the University of Illinois, as a tool to study learning and training strategies. Notably, it is one of the few cognitive training tools that has shown transfer of training to real-world performance. Flight students that trained on Space Fortress performed better on a battery of real-world flight tests, and were more likely to be selected to pursue pilot training compared to a no-training control group. Studies have also found that learning Space Fortress with a strategy that involves flexibly shifting attention to different aspects of the game results in improved learning. Thus, the Space Fortress game serves as a great tool for studying how the brain acquires new, complex skills, and how the trained ability can extend to new contexts.

Smaller optotypes are displayed as the participant correctly identifies letters, and larger ones are displayed if the participant cannot correctly identify the letter shown, until the computer has calculated the smallest size that the participant can see with the head moving. This is calculated separately for head rotation leftward and rightward from center (though the participant continues shaking the head both ways), and this performance is compared to the participant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual acuity when the head was stationary (the NIH Toolbox Visual Acuity Test score, sometimes referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cstatic\u00e2\u0080\u009d visual acuity in the context of the DVA test).

The Graded Naming Test (GNT) avoids the problem of ceiling effects in previous naming tests by having subjects name drawings of objects in ascending difficulty. Reduced efficiency in retrieving the name of an object can be the first and only indication of impaired language functioning. This test assesses object-naming ability, but is in addition graded in difficulty to allow for individual differences. This means that it may be able to detect any word-finding difficulty even in those with an extensive naming vocabulary. Currently available in UK English only (this test is culturally biased and there are no alternative versions at present).",

The displays are presented in such a way that they can easily be perceived as stacks of coloured balls held in stockings or socks suspended from a beam. This arrangement makes the 3-D concepts involved apparent to the participant, and fits with the verbal instructions.\r\n\r\nThere is a row of numbered boxes along the bottom of the screen. The test administrator first demonstrates to the participant how to use the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern in the upper display, and completes one demonstration problem, where the solution requires one move. The participant must then complete three further problems, one each of 2 moves, 3 moves and 4 moves.\r\n\r\nNext the participant is shown further problems, and must work out in their head how many moves the solutions to these problems require, then touch the appropriate box at the bottom of the screen to indicate their response.",

The task consists of two runs that each interleave 4 blocks of a story task and 4 blocks of a math task. The lengths of the blocks vary (average of approximately 30 seconds), but the task was designed so that the math task blocks match the length of the story task blocks, with some additional math trials at the end of the task to complete the 3.8 minute run as needed. The story blocks present participants with brief auditory stories (5-9 sentences) adapted from Aesop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fables, followed by a 2-alternative forcedchoice question that asks participants about the topic of the story. The example provided in the original Binder paper (p. 1466) is \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, after a story about an eagle that saves a man who had done him a favor, participants were asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas that about revenge or reciprocity?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The math task also presents trials aurally and requires subjects to complete addition and subtraction problems. The trials present subjects with a series of arithmetic operations (e.g., \u00e2\u0080\u009cfourteen plus twelve\u00e2\u0080\u009d), followed by \u00e2\u0080\u009cequals\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then two choices (e.g., \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwenty-nine or twentysix\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Participants push a button to select either the first or the second answer. The math task is adaptive to try to maintain a similar level of difficulty across participants.

In the relational processing condition, participants are presented with 2 pairs of objects, with one pair at the top of the screen and the other pair at the bottom of the screen. They are told that they should first decide what dimension differs across the top pair of objects (differed in shape or differed in texture) and then they should decide whether the bottom pair of objects also differ along that same dimension (e.g., if the top pair differs in shape, does the bottom pair also differ in shape). In the control matching condition, participants are shown two objects at the top of the screen and one object at the bottom of the screen, and a word in the middle of the screen (either \u00e2\u0080\u009cshape\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctexture\u00e2\u0080\u009d). They are told to decide whether the bottom object matches either of the top two objects on that dimension (e.g., if the word is \u00e2\u0080\u009cshape\u00e2\u0080\u009d, is the bottom object the same shape as either of the top two objects. For both conditions, the subject responds yes or no using one button or another. For the relational condition, the stimuli are presented for 3500 ms, with a 500 ms ITI, and there are four trials per block. In the matching condition, stimuli are presented for 2800 ms, with a 400 ms ITI, and there are 5 trials per block. Each type of block (relational or matching) lasts a total of 18 seconds.

Participants are told that potential card numbers range from 1-9 and to indicate if they think the mystery card number is more or less than 5 by pressing one of two buttons on the response box. Feedback is the number on the card (generated by the program as a function of whether the trial was a reward, loss or neutral trial) and either: 1) a green up arrow with \u00e2\u0080\u009c$1\u00e2\u0080\u009d for reward trials, 2) a red down arrow next to -$0.50 for loss trials; or 3) the number 5 and a gray double headed arrow for neutral trials. The \u00e2\u0080\u009c?\u00e2\u0080\u009d is presented for up to 1500 ms (if the participant responds before 1500 ms, a fixation cross is displayed for the remaining time), following by feedback for 1000 ms.

Here the implementation of Van der Laan (2014) is described. \r\n\r\nIn the food choice task, participants make a total of 100 choices. In every trial, a high energy (HE) (energy content in kcal/100 gram: M = 419, SD = 103) and a low energy (LE) (M = 56, SD = 37) snack are shown side by side. Participants have 3000 ms to indicate which of the two products they would most like to eat a portion of by pushing the left or right but ton of a button box. After indicating their choice, a yellow box appears around the chosen product for 500 ms. The trials are interspersed with a random interval between 2000 and 5000 ms.\r\n\r\nTo investigate response conflict during food choice participants  are required to choose between pairs of HE and LE snacks matched such (on the basis of their own tastiness ratings given in the first session) that either a self-control dilemma was posed or not. In half of the trials, LE snacks are combined with HE snacks rated two or three points higher on tastiness (Self-Control required(SC)trials), posing a self-control dilemma concerning the trade-off between immediate eating enjoyment (choosing the appealing HE snack) and weight-watching intentions (choosing the less appealing LE snack). In the other half of the trials, the LE and HE snacks are matched on tastiness (equal or \u00c2\u00b11 point in tastiness rating; No Self-Control required (NSC) trials), such that no trade-off between eating enjoyment and weight watching intentions is needed to choose the long-term superior LE snack.\r\n\r\nThe visual stimuli consist of 100 pictures of regularly available snack foods on plates with a grey background: 50 high energy (HE) foods (energy content in kcal/100gram: M = 419, SD = 103) and 50 low energy (LE) foods (M = 56, SD = 37). Examples of HE snacks were crisps, cookies, cakes and candies. Examples of LE snacks were grapes, apples, bananas and mixed snack salads.

In phase 1, the various stimuli are always presented in pairs, where the sum of the two reward probabilities associated with each stimuli equal 100%.  For example, stim 1 will always be paired with stim 6 (80%+20%=100%).  Subjects eventually learn that for each pair, choosing one stimuli over the other results in more reward (80%>20%).  The subject is tested on this association in phase two.  During phase two, the subject must decide between novel combinations of stimuli. Each stimuli is presented with the remaining four stimuli that it was not paired with in phase 1.  For example, stim1 (80%) can be paired with either stim2(70%), stim3(60%), stim4(40%), or stim5(30%), but not with itself or with the stimuli it was associated with during phase 1, stim6 (20%).

Each route contains an initial segment that is shared with another route , and a later segment, including the destination, that is route-specific. Although the real-world spatial locations of the overlapping segments are identical, the pictures for each route are taken at different times and therefore differ subtly in terms of pedestrians, vehicles, etc. Routes are studied twice per round for 14 rounds. Subjects are instructed to learn each route (i.e., the specific path to each destination) but are not told the destination at the start of the route. After each study round, subjects are shown individual pictures drawn from the routes and are asked to select the destination associated with each picture. Of central interest is accuracy for pictures drawn from Segment 1 of each route because selecting the correct destination for these pictures requires discriminating between overlapping routes. \r\n\r\nFor more details, see: http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/10/099226",

    "definition_text": "The Yellow Light Game (YLG) is a computerized driving simulation task that was modified from the Stoplight Task (Gardner & Steinberg, 2005; Chein et al., 2011). Similar to the Stoplight Task, each run in the YLG involves participants driving on a straight road with 20 intersections, each controlled by a traffic light. Participants are instructed that the goal of the game is to get the fastest time. At each intersection, when the traffic light turns yellow, participants choose to either continue through the intersection (Go decision), or to stop the car (Stop decision); they are not able to accelerate or steer. Participants are instructed that Go decisions would result in the fastest time, unless another car is present on the cross street, in which case the participant would crash. Crashes double the time spent at an intersection compared to if the participant had decided to stop. Therefore, Go decisions are considered \u00e2\u0080\u0098risky\u00e2\u0080\u0099, whereas Stop decisions are considered \u00e2\u0080\u0098safe\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Upon completion of a run, participants are presented with their completion time and the number of crashes during that run.\r\n\r\nA unique feature of the YLG is that there are three different types of intersections, which vary based on the timing of yellow light onset and the presence or absence of a car on the cross street. Some intersections have a 75% probability of crashing, others have a 25% probability of crashing, and the remaining intersections have a 50% probability of crashing. To prevent the task from promoting risk taking overall, the cumulative probability of crashing is set to 50% (i.e., 10 out of the 20 intersections have cars approaching on the cross street, resulting in a crash if the participant made a Go decision). This task feature is not explicitly communicated to participants, although participants have the opportunity to implicitly learn this information based on the differential timing of the yellow light onsets associated with each type of intersection. That is, intersections at which the light turns yellow earlier (i.e., when the participant was further away from the intersection) signal a greater crash probability. By including the different types of intersections, we are able to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive risk taking, without promoting risk taking overall, as the cumulative probability of crashing is 50%.

    "definition_text": "The episodic recombination paradigm (Addis et al., 2009) was designed to study episodic simulations (remembering past events, or imagining novel future events). In this paradigm, participants first provide a set of autobiographical memories, each comprised of a set of details, e.g., a person, place, and object. They later return for a separate session in which they are cued to recall some of these episodes. For the imagination trials, details concerning person, place, and object are experimentally recombined across events, and participants are asked to imagine an event that might occur in the future involving the recombined set of details. Participants press a button once they have constructed the past or future event and after that continue to simulate the event, generating as much detail as possible. This is typically followed by ratings of phenomenological characteristics of the simulated events, e.g., detail or difficulty. \r\n\r\n(description adapted from Addis et al., 2010)",

    "definition_text": "The EAT is a modified Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm providing behavioral and neural indices of both error awareness and inhibitory control. Participants are shown color words (e.g., red, blue, green) printed in congruent or incongruent fonts (as in a Stroop task) such that most stimuli are congruent (80%; e.g., the word \u201cBLUE\u201d in blue font). Congruent stimuli are Go trials requiring a button-press response (eg., button 1). In contrast, participants are to withhold button-presses when either the same color word is repeated on two successive trials (No-Go Rule-1) or an incongruent stimulus is presented (e.g., the word \u201cBLUE\u201d in red font; No-Go Rule-2). Continuously monitoring both No-Go rules is difficult and participants are predisposed to monitor for REPEAT (Rule-1) more so than INCONGRUENT trials (Rule-2). This leads to a sufficient number of errors (~45%), a portion of which remain undetected by participants (~10-20%). The task begins with words presented for 900ms followed by a 600ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI). To equate task performance across groups and maintain overall errors at ~45%, task difficulty dynamically adapts based on individual performance by varying the stimulus presentation and ISI durations. Participants indicate \u201cerror awareness\u201d by pressing a separate 'error signaling button' (e.g., button 2) on the trial following a commission error.",

The twenty-eight words were synthesized using Mbrola speech synthesizer software by concatenating diphones from the Spanish male database (http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/) at 16 KHz. Words (385 ms), were combined using Adobe Audition\u00ae software to form three-word phrases with 100 ms gaps between word. Phrase stimuli were presented via Presentation\u00ae software (Neurobehavioral Systems) through appropriate headphones and at a volume level adjusted for the participant.\r\nA total of 96 rule and 96 no-rule phrases (trials) were used in this task. Rule phrases conformed to an AXC structure whereby the initial word (A) always predicted the final word (C), while the middle word (X) was variable. Two different A_C dependencies (A1_C1 and A2_C2) were created out of 4 words from the total word pool. The remaining 24 served as middle (X) elements for each of the two A_C dependencies. The transitional probability was always 1 between A and C elements, 0.04 between A and X, and 0.5 between X and C. Half of the no-rule trials consisted in the combination of 3 of the 24 X elements and so took the form XXX, with the only constraints that each X had an equal probability to appear in each position but could never appear twice in the same phrase. The other half of the no-rule trials consisted of the combination of two XX elements (following the same constraints as for XXX) followed by the participant\u2019s target word (C1 or C2). The probability of target occurrence in both the rule and the no-rule blocks was therefore 50%. Note that in the set of no-rule trials, the C element (the participant\u2019s target) occurred also in the last position but, in contrast to the rule block, this could not be predicted on the basis of previous elements. \r\nParticipants were presented with the randomized 96 rule and 96 no-rule phrases in four alternated rule and no-rule blocks, with the order of blocks counterbalanced between participants. In the fMRI version of the task, data was acquired in two runs, including a block of rule and no-rule each (counterbalanced). A short break was given between runs in the fMRI. A single offline recognition test was issued after the fourth block . In order to obtain a measure of incidental rule-learning, participants performed a cover word-monitoring task. Specifically, they were instructed to detect, as fast and accurately as possible via a button press, the presence or absence of a given target word, which was always one of the C elements (C1 or C2, counterbalanced). A given target word remained constant for each participant throughout the experiment and was displayed in the middle of the screen at all times for reference during the blocks. Participants were not informed about the presence of rules. Inter-trial interval was jittered, using pseudo-random values between 1000 and 3000 ms for optimal fMRI acquisition, and fixed at 500 ms in the remaining phases. A maximum of 1000 ms after the end of a given phrase was allowed for participants to respond before the next trial started. Reaction times (RTs) were calculated from the onset the last word in the phrase until button press. Performance in interleaved rule and no-rule blocks was jointly analyzed by concatenating blocks of a same kind. Only correct response trials with RTs within mean \u00b1 2sd were included for the analysis .\r\n\r\nWe reasoned that if incidental rule-learning occurs over exposure in the rule block, participants\u2019 gradual ability to predict the appearance or non-appearance of a target word Cj on the basis of the identity of the initial word Aj should be reflected in a RT gain (i.e., faster RTs) over trials within the blocks. We also expected an overall RT advantage over target words in the no-rule blocks (rule effect), where prediction is possible (no prediction can be made during no-rule blocks). Participants\u2019 rule effect for the different parts/sessions was calculated as the mean RT difference between no-rule and rule trials. \r\n",

The task has an entertaining and timely design understandable and engaging for children as well as for adults.

Each condition comprises 10 stories of similar visual complexity (i.e. backgrounds were matched across conditions). Three additional stories (one per condition) are available for practice purposes.  <br>AT trials require participants to infer how a character would react to a fellow character\u2019s expressed or expected emotions, whereas during CT trials participants have to assume how characters would act based on another character\u2019s intentions or beliefs. PC trials serve as a control condition, requiring a basic understanding of cause and effect and basic physical laws.<br>All trials start with three images presented sequentially, followed by a single image display of three possible endings. CT trial endings consist of one correct, and two incorrect solutions. Incorrect solutions depict either a situation which would be illogical based on the storyline or physically impossible (e.g. object flies, character transforms). AT trial endings consist of two correct solutions (negative expectancy/positive expectancy) and one incorrect solution. In positive expectancy endings a character\u2019s emotional needs are met with caring or reassuring, whereas in negative expectancy outcomes the character is scolded, ridiculed or ignored. This manipulation allows the investigation of differences in positive or negative outcome expectancy. PC trial endings have one correct and two incorrect solutions.<br><br><br><b>Developers' website: </b>https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/developmental_neuroscience/downloads/catoon.html",
